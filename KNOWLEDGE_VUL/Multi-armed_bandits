Multi-armed bandits are a classic problem in probability theory and machine learning that exemplifies the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Here are some key points about multi-armed bandits:

Problem setup:

There are multiple "arms" (choices/actions) available, each with an unknown probability distribution of rewards.
The goal is to maximize total reward over time by sequentially selecting arms.

Key challenge:
Balancing exploration (trying different arms to learn about their rewards) vs exploitation (selecting the arm that seems best so far).

Common algorithms:
Epsilon-greedy: Choose the best arm with probability 1-ε, and explore randomly with probability ε.
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): Select arms based on their estimated value plus an uncertainty bonus.
Thompson Sampling: Sample from posterior distributions of arm values and choose the highest.

Applications:
A/B testing and website optimization
Clinical trials
Online advertising
Recommendation systems

Advantages over traditional A/B testing:
Can adapt more quickly as data is gathered.
Minimizes "regret" by shifting traffic to better performing options.

Variants:
Contextual bandits: Arm selection depends on contextual information.
Non-stationary bandits: Reward distributions change over time.

Challenges:
More complex to implement than simple A/B tests.
Requires careful tuning of exploration parameters.
Multi-armed bandits provide a framework for making sequential decisions under uncertainty, balancing learning about the environment with maximizing rewards based on current knowledge.
